# From https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/
# 'read' was misbehaving with /bin/sh and my base is ubuntu so I'm using /bin/bash
#
# I also had issues getting 'read' to behave by itself so I introduced the named pipe
# as a control mechanism. In this version, anything you send will cause it to exit
# but we may do more interesting things in the future.
#

# Note: I've written this using sh so it works in the busybox container too

# USE the trap if you need to also do manual cleanup after the service is stopped,
#     or need to start multiple services in the one container
trap "echo TRAPed signal" HUP INT QUIT KILL TERM

# Start anything that wants to start before we start apache
for i in /usr/local/bin/apache2.start.d/*
do
  [ -x "$i" ] && $i "$@"
done

# start service in background here
/usr/sbin/apachectl start

echo "[hit enter key to exit] or run 'docker stop <container>'"
read < /var/run/container-control

# Stop anything that wants to stop before we stop apache
for i in /usr/local/bin/apache2.stop.d/*
do
  [ -x "$i" ] && $i "$@"
